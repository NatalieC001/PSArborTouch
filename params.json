The inspiration / structure comes from [arbor] (https://github.com/samizdatco/arbor), a dynamic and well structured javascript engine for the same purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Example Projects\r\n\r\nThis distribution contains several examples that demonstrate the features of PSArborTouch.  This includes those found in arbor.js and a few more that explore other uses.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Status\r\n\r\n_The library is function but it is still a work in progress, see [issues](https://github.com/epreston/PSArborTouch/issues) and [milestones](https://github.com/epreston/PSArborTouch/issues/milestones)_\r\n\r\nPSArborTouch is a drop in solution that uses a GCD to keep the main application loop free and responsive.\r\n\r\nThis project follows the [SemVer](http://semver.org/) standard. The API may change in backwards-incompatible ways before the 1.0 release.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\nYou can generate documentation with [doxygen](http://www.doxygen.org). The example project includes a documentation build target to do this within Xcode.    For more details, see the [Documentation](https://github.com/epreston/PSArborTouch/wiki/Documentation) page in this projects wiki.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Contribute\r\n\r\nIf you'd like to contribute to PSArborTouch, start by forking this repository on GitHub:\r\n\r\nhttp://github.com/epreston/PSArborTouch\r\n\r\nThe best way to get your changes merged back into core is as follows:\r\n\r\n1. Clone down your fork\r\n1. Create a thoughtfully named topic branch to contain your change\r\n1. Hack away\r\n1. Add tests and make sure everything still passes\r\n1. If you are adding new functionality, document it in the README\r\n1. Do not change the version number, I will do that on my end\r\n1. If necessary, rebase your commits into logical chunks, without errors\r\n1. Push the branch up to GitHub\r\n1. Send a pull request to the epreston/PSArborTouch project.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Copyright and License\r\n\r\nCopyright 2011 Preston Software.\r\n\r\n   Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\r\n   you may not use this work except in compliance with the License.\r\n   You may obtain a copy of the License in the LICENSE file, or at:\r\n\r\n       http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\r\n\r\n   Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\r\n   distributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\r\n   WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\r\n   See the License for the specific language governing permissions and\r\n   limitations under the License.\r\n\r\n\r\n","tagline":"PSArborTouch is a particle / spring physics engine optimised for 2D content layout and eye-catching visual effects.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
