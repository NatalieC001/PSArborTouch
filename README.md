# PSArborTouch

PSArborTouch is a particle / spring physics engine optimised for 2D content layout and eye-catching visual effects.

The goal of PSArborTouch is to build a high-quality physics based graph layout engine designed specifically for the iOS.  The inspiration / structure comes from Arbor, a dynamic and well structured javascript engine for the same purpose.

# Example Project

There is an iPad example application to demonstrate the features of PSArborTouch.


# Status

PSArborTouch is a drop in solution that uses a separate thread to keep the main application loop free and responsive.

This project follows the [SemVer](http://semver.org/) standard. The API may change in backwards-incompatible ways before the 1.0 release.


# Documentation

You can generate documentation with [doxygen](http://www.doxygen.org). The example project includes a documentation build target to do this within Xcode.    For more details, see the [Documentation](https://github.com/epreston/PSArborTouch/wiki/Documentation) page in this projects wiki.
